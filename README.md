# Temperature-Prediction-Regression-Model
In this project , using the available datasets of temperature and Green House Gas emission for individual country, we try to design a Linear Regression Model and test it's reliability and using the model , predict future temperature of a region .It uses Linear Regression in scikit-learn module in python .
Scikit Learn is an open-source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, preprocessing, cross-validation, and visualization 
algorithms using a unified interface.

It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector 
machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, etc.

It is built on the top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib . 

The following datasets are used and referenced from Kaggle :

1. CO2 Gas Emission Emission DataSet [1751-2017] 
It contains the Annual Emission Data of CO2 between the time period 1751-2017 for 231 Regions.

2. Annual Temperature DataSet [1744-2013]
It contains the Monthly Temperature between the Time period 1744-2013 for 218 Regions .

The datasets can be used in either of Google Colab and Local Machines using pandas library.

The practical methodology is described in the repository 'implementation.pdf' file.
